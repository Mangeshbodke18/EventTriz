    <h1><i>India`s Best event Managers</i></h1>
    <h5> Jan 18, 2024 1 </h5>
    
    <p>There are countless event management blogs out there, but nobody has time to read them all. So which ones have the best information to get you ahead in the events industry.

        Here our list of six event planning blogs that always teach us something new. To avoid bias, we’re leaving the Social Tables blog off the list. (But you should still probably check it out!)

    <h2>Plan The Best Day.Ever</h2>
        <p>One way to make someone's day is to quickly send a message to someone letting them know you're thinking about them. Might even be a good idea to bring up a specific memory you share with this person. This will allow them to replay the memory, the feelings surrounding it and spring them into feeling good.</p>

        <h2>Casual Meetings</h2>
          <p>In essence, a formal meeting has a structured schedule and agenda with set protocols and an official notetaker. An informal meeting has a looser agenda and fewer protocols. In general, formal meetings tend to focus on one or a few key speakers, with attendees playing a more passive role.</p>
